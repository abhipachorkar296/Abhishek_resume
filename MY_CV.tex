% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\runsubsection{Showman}
\descript{Software Engineering Intern}
\location{April 2020 - May 2020}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Handled optimized distribution of video content using AWS's CloudFront CDN and a Load Balancer to distribute requests made.
\item Built APIs using Ruby on Rails for adding Elastic-search into the backend, Also integrated Twilio's SMS API for authentication.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Synchem Pharmaceuticals}
\descript{Backend Development Intern}
\location{June 2020 - August 2020}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built an inventory management system with double accounting from scratch while working closely with CTO 
\item Used Django REST Framework, Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Redis. For handling tasks asynchronously, designed and implemented a task queue handler derived from Celery.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{\href{https://github.com/abhipachorkar296/Nexus}{Nexus}}
\descript{Kshitij 2020 Challenge}
\begin{tightemize}
\item {\emph{Problem Statement}:} Use a monocular camera to guide a bot through grey-scale environment.   
\item Executed different approaches using Python-OpenCV functions to extract exact path boundaries including implementing generalized Huff Transform and contour detection using gradients and guide the bot to destination. 
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Path Planning Using RRT* Algorithm}
\descript{ARK Task Round}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Optimized multiple data structures and path-finding algorithms such as RRT*(Rapidly-exploring random trees) to find a solution for a given dynamic maze with moving obstacles in random motion. Implemented it in C++ using OpenCV.
\item Developed a new algorithm to plot disparity map of two stereo images and applied it to plot depth gradients .
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\runsubsection{Beatcovid}
\descript{}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a tool to efficiently match medical supplies to hospitals that need them the most by considering the distance, town population, and other heuristics.
\item The app, built with Flask and MySQL allowed hospitals to list essential supplies they need urgently and government factories to arrange for them rapidly in COVID-19 pandemic.
