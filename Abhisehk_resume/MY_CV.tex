% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{PROJECTS}

\runsubsection{AERIAL ROBOTICS KHARAGPUR}
\descript{Software Team Member}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Aerial Robotics Kharagpur is a research group mainly involved in the development of autonomous drones performing various tasks.   
\item Part of a software team which worked on ORB-SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) which is an indoor localisation algorithm for drones.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{\href{https://github.com/abhipachorkar296/crusade}{CRUSADE}}
\descript{Kshitij 2019 Challenge}
\begin{tightemize}
\item {\emph{Problem Statement}:} Used a monocular camera to guide a bot through grey-scale environment.   
\item Executed different approaches using Python-OpenCV functions to extract exact path boundaries including implementing generalized Huff Transform and contour detection using gradients. 
\item Used the path boundaries to estimate state of bot and required control inputs to guide it to destination.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Path Planning Using RRT* Algorithm}
\descript{ARK Task Round}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Optimized multiple data structures and path-finding algorithms such as RRT*(Rapidly-exploring random trees) to find a solution for a given dynamic maze with moving obstacles in random motion. Implemented it in C++ using OpenCV.
\item Developed a new algorithm to plot disparity map of two stereo images and applied it to plot depth gradients .
